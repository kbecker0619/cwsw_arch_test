# Reusable Component : MCU Architecture Support

This folder is the "parent" for the MCU architectures supported by the CWSW Software libraries.

There is one directory for each supported architecture; in your build system, simply exclude all architectures except for the one around which your project is built.

Please see the detailed design documentation, created by Doxygen, for detailed information.
